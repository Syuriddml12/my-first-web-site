<h1>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h1>
The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is <strong>the standard <u>markup</u> language</strong> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
<br><br><br>
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. 
<p style="margin-top:50px">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. </p>
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
